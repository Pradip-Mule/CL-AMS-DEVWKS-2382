    "\n",
    "## What are React Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "React (Reasoning + Acting) Agents are a type of AI agent designed to dynamically reason about tasks and take actions based on the environment and available tools. \n",
    "Unlike traditional static AI models, React Agents combine **thought generation** with **action execution**, iteratively refining their decisions using feedback from observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "React Agents are particularly useful in tasks requiring **multi-step reasoning**, **tool usage**, and **adaptive decision-making**, making them ideal for applications such as automated assistants, network configuration, and problem-solving systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of React Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative Thought and Action Loop**: The agent cycles through **thought, action, observation, and reasoning** to improve decision-making.\n",
    "- **Tool Use and Interaction**: It can invoke external tools such as databases, APIs, and computational functions to obtain necessary information.\n",
    "- **Self-Correction and Adaptability**: React Agents refine their approach based on real-time feedback, making them more efficient in complex environments.\n"

    "1. **Import Libraries**:\n",
    "   - `openai`: The Python client for interacting with the OpenAI API. Weâ€™ll use it to send requests to the OpenAI API and generate text completions.\n",
    "   - `re`: A library for working with regular expressions. It helps us manipulate strings and perform complex string matching operations.\n",
    "   - `httpx`: An HTTP client that supports asynchronous requests, useful for making API calls.\n",
    "   - `os`: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including working with environment variables.\n",
    "   - `dotenv`: A module to load environment variables from a `.env` file, which is useful for storing sensitive information like API keys securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading Environment Variables**:\n",
    "   - `load_dotenv()`: This function loads variables from a `.env` file into the environment. It allows us to store sensitive information, like our OpenAI API key, outside of the code, keeping it secure and preventing accidental exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Importing OpenAI Class**:\n",
    "   - `from openai import OpenAI`: This imports the necessary components from the OpenAI Python client to interact with the API.\n",

    "   - **Thought**: The agent starts by reflecting on the question it has been asked. This is the agentâ€™s internal step of analyzing what it knows and deciding how to proceed with answering the question.\n",
    "   - **Action**: Based on the thought, the agent will perform one of the available actions. Actions include running calculations or looking up specific information.\n",
    "   - **PAUSE**: After executing an action, the agent pauses and waits for the result, allowing time for the action to complete and provide an output.\n",
    "   - **Observation**: The result of the action is observed and returned to the agent. The observation informs the agentâ€™s next steps.\n",
    "   - **Answer**: Finally, after receiving the observation, the agent uses the information to provide a clear and concise answer to the original question.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Available Actions**:\n",
    "   - **calculate**: The agent can perform calculations using Python syntax. For example, `calculate: 4 * 7 / 3` will return the result of this mathematical operation.\n",
    "   - **average_elephant_weight**: This action allows the agent to retrieve the average weight of an elephant species based on the species name. For example, `average_elephant_weight: African Elephant` will return the average weight of an African Elephant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Session**:\n",
    "   - **Question**: \"How much does an African Elephant weigh?\"\n",
    "   - **Thought**: The agent decides it needs to look up the weight of the elephant.\n",
    "   - **Action**: The agent performs the action `average_elephant_weight: African Elephant` to find the weight of an African Elephant.\n",
    "   - **PAUSE**: The agent waits for the response from the action.\n",
    "   - **Observation**: The result is received: \"An African Elephant weighs 12,000 lbs.\"\n",
    "   - **Answer**: The agent then outputs: \"An African Elephant weighs 12,000 lbs.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this tutorial, we learned how to build a simple reactive agent using Python. The agent processes user input through a structured loop of Thought, Action, and Observation, enabling it to reason and perform tasks. We defined actions such as calculations and retrieving specific data (e.g., elephant weights). The agent dynamically interacts with these actions and updates its state to answer complex questions. This approach allows the agent to handle various tasks effectively by combining reasoning with real-time execution of actions.\n"
